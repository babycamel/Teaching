    "1. A Trader has access to grain storage capcity in Chicago. The monthly cost of storage is $0.04/bushel and the trader's cost of capital is 0.5\\% per month. The trader's main business is to purchasegrain in the spot market and deliver it against a short futures contract, or to accept delivery of  grain via long futures contract and then sell the grain in the spot market (assume that these activities can be done at zero cost). In the set of pricing scenarios listed below identify those that can be arbitraged (be sure to describe the specific arbitrage strategy). As well, explain what will happen to market prices if a larger number of traderspursue similar arbitrage activities. To simplify the discussion, assume that the commodity can only be delivered against a futures contract on the last day of the contract's expiry month.\n",
